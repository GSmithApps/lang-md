# old

open the devtools with option+cmd+c

run the following `python -m http.server 8000`

nav to `http://localhost:8000`

todo:
- all that's left is moving over extension.js
- put it in a vscode extension
- code wrapping for newline. for example, `fn divide`...
  it currently makes everything shrink or grow at its mercy
- if the code ends on something like `$ }`, then it won't
  render that line. it might have something to do with
  the break statement
